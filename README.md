I am Abhishek. Out of office either I strum my ukulele, binge-read an author, work on existing pending projects or mostly, day-dream about building stuffs. But as they say, âœ¨ _if you can dream it, you can do it_ âœ¨ ( liked this quote from random google motivation image ). I work with React and node environments.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a CSS config generator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about UI design, DevOps and playing Ukulele ðŸŽ¸
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on component-libraries, UI components and design.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with scaling design primitives ( having decided basic design primitives, formulating and extending them to set app themes and generate style variations )
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about UI development. I have worked extensively with developing dashboards. Drop me a message, I'll be happy to help in my capacity.
