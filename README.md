I am Abhishek. I create things at [GeekyAnts](www.geekyants.com). Out of office either I strum my ukulele, binge-read an author, work on existing pending projects or mostly, day-dream about building stuffs. But as they say, ✨ _if you can dream it, you can do it_ ✨ ( liked this quote from random google motivation image ). I work with React and node environments.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a CSS config generator (🤭) and automated testing architecture
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about UI design and playing Ukulele 🎸
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on component-libraries, UI components and design.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with scaling design primitives ( having decided basic design primitives, formulating and extending them to set app themes and generate style variations )
- 💬 Ask me about UI development. I have worked extensively with developing dashboards. Drop me a message, I'll be happy to help in my capacity.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://geekyants.com/abhishek-pundir
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him
- ⚡ Fun fact: will be introducing CSS config generator soon 🎉
